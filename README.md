# Colorful Logger

A simple and lightweight Dart package for printing colorful logs in the terminal.  
With `colorful_logger`, you can easily differentiate between different levels of logs: `info`, `warning`, and `error`â€”all displayed with distinct colors.

## Features

- Color-coded log levels:
  - **Info** logs are displayed in green.
  - **Warning** logs are displayed in yellow.
  - **Error** logs are displayed in red.
- Time-stamped logs for better debugging.
- Simple and intuitive API.

```yaml

```bash

```

## Usage

To use `colorful_logger` in your Flutter or Dart project:

1. Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:colorful_logger/colorful_logger.dart';
```

2. Start logging:

```dart
void main() {
  Logger.info('Application started successfully.');
  Logger.warning('This is a warning log.');
  Logger.error('An error occurred.');
}
```

### Example Output
In the terminal, the logs appear with timestamps and different colors:

```
MyApp [12:34:56] INFO: Application started successfully.
MyApp [12:34:57] WARNING: This is a warning log.
MyApp [12:34:58] ERROR: An error occurred.
```

> **Note:** The colors are visible only in terminal outputs that support ANSI escape codes.
